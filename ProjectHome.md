this project is for a large music retail company with multiple stores and an on-line outlet (like Virgin or Music World), called herein Allegro Music Store (or AMS), or simply "the company". The rest of this section provides a detailed description of the basic operations which the users of the database system expect to perform.

The main function of AMS is to sell music to its customers. AMS has  a number of stores in a number of cities in Canada and also has an online outlet. A store is uniquely identified by a name (like Vancouver-Main ), and  has an address, city and phone associated with it. There is a special store called "Warehouse" that only services the online orders. Each store keeps two types of music:  audio CD's and DVD's with music videos. The stores have also music books and  sheet music. Each item is uniquely identified by a universal product code (UPC). For each audio CD and  DVD we need to record their title, the leading singer(s) or group, the production company and  year,  and the titles of the songs which are  contained in it.  Each CD and DVD belongs to one of the following music categories: rock, pop, rap, country, classical, new age and instrumental.  Each book has a title, one or more authors,  a publisher and a year. Finally a music score has a title, one or more composers and a publishing company.
